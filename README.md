# Day 31 - 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023

## Flashcard app - tool for learning a new language
- Choose between 4 languages: French, German, Romanian, Spanish
- Each language data contains around 1000 words
- On the front of the card is a word in chosen language and the translation in English is on the back of the card
- After 3 seconds the card flips and you can check whether you knew the right answer or not
- Press on "❌" if you didn't know the answer or "✔" if you are confidence that you learnt that word
- All the cards with "❌" answer will go back into the deck and come up again at some point
- All the cards with "✔" answer will be removed from the list of cards to be kept only the unknown words
- The progress will be saved in an additional csv file for chosen language, and the list of cards will be shown from this progress file
